# Anyware_Software_Project
This is a task for the company Anyware Software
The idea behind this project is to create a dashboard consisting of two pages. The first page contains a button named "Login." When clicked, it directs the user to the dashboard, saving a token in the local storage. This token signifies that the person who clicked the "Login" button is now logged in and will be redirected to the second page, known as the dashboard. On the dashboard, there is a "Logout" button. Clicking on it removes the token from the local storage, logging the person out.

In the dashboard, users can view all announcements and quizzes. Additionally, there are links on the left side of the project. Clicking on any of these links navigates the user to another page corresponding to the clicked link. A component named "requiredAuth" is used to protect the routes, ensuring a secure user experience. The project is designed to be responsive on all screens.

Several packages were utilized in this project, including axios, bootstrap, fontawesome, and react-router-dom. On the backend, various endpoints were implemented, each supporting HTTP methods such as PUT, DELETE, POST, and GET. For handling asynchronous operations, packages such as nodemon, express, express-handler-async, cors, joi, dotenv, and jsonwebtoken were employed. The project includes login and register endpoints to manage user authentication.In the backend project, I created three files for controllers. The first file manages login and register functionalities, the second handles announcements, and the third is responsible for quizzes. Additionally, I created three corresponding route files based on the controllers. These routes are then utilized in the app.js file, and used middlewares.
